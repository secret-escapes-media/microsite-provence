    title: Steeped in History
    description: Walk Roman roads, discover the palace of the Popes, lose yourself in medieval towns, and explore a region brimming with a fascinating history.

    highlights:

        title: Roman Legacy
        description: Provence boasts some of the most impressive Roman relics in the whole of France. The region was strategic and bountiful for the empire, with cities springing up across the land. Discover the Roman town of Glanum with its impressive triumphal arch and the vast Pont du Gard aqueduct, between which you’ll find a host of original Roman bridges and roads. Certain ruins still dominate the old cities and towns – Arles Amphitheatre and the ancient theatre at Orange remain towering reminders of Provence’s ancient roots, both UNESCO sites and still hosting events to this day.

      - id: medieval-towns
        title: Medieval Towns
        description: Provence’s medieval towns and villages are a romantic vision of rural life in the south of France. Sat high on clifftops, often ringed-in by thick masonry and topped by a palatial keep, these towns and villages string together in a way that positively welcomes days of exploring each one-by-one. Discover the vast towers of Uzès, where the duke still lives in the grand castle, or the rustic streets of Lourmarin which won awards for its beauty, or the burnt-orange palette of Roussillon – the list is satisfyingly long.

        title: The Spiritual
        description: With such a long history, Provence cemented its spiritual capital early in its years. Roman and medieval churches fill the region, many with 5th century origins like the cathedral in Aix, and the late-Roman Saint-Victor Abbey. Provence’s biggest spiritual icon remains the Palais des Papes in Avignon, with its vast gothic edifice and dominating stature hinting at the significance of the Avignon Papacy during the Middle Ages. However, remarkable sites like the 12th century Abbeye de Thoronet and iconic Abbaye Notre Dame de Senanque, with the rolling lavender fields that lead up to it, are to this day fascinating pilgrimage sites for history buffs and culture lovers. The much later notre dame de la garde in Marseille is certainly a crowning achievement though. Quite literally, crowning the peak above the city, it’s a wonder of 19th-century Byzantine Revivalism.

    title: A Region of Inspiration
    description: Provence is demonstrably a land that has inspired some of the finest artists and writers the world has ever known. Walk in their footsteps and discover a region of flourishing creativity.

        title: Meet the Artists
        description: Provence has constantly drawn artists from far and wide. At a quick glance, it’s not hard to see why. The food, the weather, the lifestyle – it’s an incredibly tempting hideaway. From the coast to the mountains, Provence’s list of artists-in-residence reads like a who’s-who of the most celebrated and influential of their field – Van Gogh, Picasso, Monet, Matisse, Chagall, Renoir, Cézanne, Puget – many of whom settled here for some time. Whether it was the fair weather or the famous wine, Van Gogh in particular attributed it to the colour palette and light of this beautiful region.

        title: Visit their Homes
        description: Visit the villages and towns that these illustrious artists were inspired by. Renoir was first to popularise the region, with Monet, Matisse and Cézanne quickly following. Aix-en-Provence was the hangout of Cézanne, now beset with an art trail dedicated to him. It was motivation enough for Picasso, who lived his final days in the Château de Vauvenargues under the Sainte-Victoire mountain – immortalised on canvas by Cézanne. Van Gogh found his home in Arles, painting some of his finest works in the region and, regrettably, hacking his ear off here.

        description: With such a fine artistic pedigree, Provence naturally offers a wealth of renowned art galleries. They scatter themselves throughout the region, offering art trails that extend from coast to mountain through the glorious Provence countryside. Marseille has the new MuCEM, plus the Regional Funds of Contemporary Art (FRAC) and the Museum of Contemporary Art (MAC), making it the veritable home of, to push the point, contemporary art. Aix-en-Provence is home to the Musée Granet and Hôtel de Caumont, whereas Avignon offers the Collection Lambert and Musée Calvet, each spanning collections from Ancient Greece to the present day. Le Musée de l’Annonciade in St Tropez offers a wide curation of 20th century works, completing any art lover’s adventure in this demonstrably creative region.
