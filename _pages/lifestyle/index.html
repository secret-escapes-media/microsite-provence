        description: Provence is guaranteed to give you lifestyle envy. Here, the living is good. From the bustling markets to the lively cafés and bars, Provençal life is laid-back, a fine balance of indulgence and activity. Sitting al fresco along charming boulevards, a refreshing rosé in hand and tapenade ready to be picked at, walking past softly-scented fields of lavender, and listening to the soft clicking sound of the pétanque game in the square. A pastis before dinner, a bottle from the cellar to accompany your evening as the sun slinks away… It’s a life worth living to its fullest, if even for a snapshot.

        title: Hidden Gems
        description: To really live Provençal, you need to go where the locals go. Provence is one of France’s most popular destinations and for good reason, but even here lies a host of undiscovered gems that remain relatively off-the-beaten-path. Stumble upon glorious medieval hilltop villages across the region, like Les Baux-de-Provence and Gordes, the latter known as the most beautiful village in France. They enchant at every turn, often hosting exquisite restaurants and impressive cellar bars. Wild swimming is another French favourite, with Sillans-la-Cascade being a serene hideaway beset with a waterfall for a truly picturesque cool-down under the hot sun. Spark up a conversation over a pastis to unpick your very own local’s faves.

        title: Party with Locals
        description: Festivals and events are a big part of the Provençal lifestyle. They showcase the creativity and unique culture of the region, allowing any visitor to immerse themselves in the tapestry of life in Provence. MP2018 promises such immersion, with no less than six months of revelry united under the theme of love. From February 14th to September 1st, enjoy spellbinding fireworks displays, operas, concerts, circuses and much more. The events are happening across the region, offering a great excuse to explore everything Provence, and this festival, has to offer. The most convivial of all Provençal experiences has to be the Sardinades of Martigues. Hosted in a square of Provence’s ‘little Venice’, it’s a summer evening feast for locals and visitors punctuated by live music to deal with, of all things, the overabundance of sardines. For those looking for a culture fix head to Festival d’Avignon, one of the most important contemporary performing arts events in the world.

        title: Close to Sea
        description: Near the stunning Mediterranean coastline lie outdoor scenes set to beguile any visitor. At the western point of the region, marked by the Rhône river delta, lies the Camargue. The wetlands host an array of bird life, along with iconic, wild white horses and flamingos basking in the sun. Bulls are herded by local cowboys setting the scene for a unique rural escape. East of the Camargue between Marseille and Cassis, you’ll find the white rocky outcrops of Les Calanques, that line the coastline here. Falling steeply into the sea, they offer up private coves and beaches, either accessible by a hike or by boat. For a serene spot on a quiet beach, discover the hidden shores of Les Calanques. For thrills, head further along the coast to Almanarre in Hyères, where a startlingly long beach is a mecca for parasailers and funboarders.

        title: Unforgettable Colours
        description: Provence is blessed with a sublime natural colour palette, a fact not lost on the artists who trailed the land in search of inspiration. The most iconic has to be the lavender fields, which grow across Luberon, Haute-Provence and Mont Ventoux. They bloom between June and August and once harvested, the villages and towns are filled with handcrafted lavender products that make perfect gifts. The Ochre Trail outside of Roussillon is of nice contrast to the deep purple of the fields. This burnt-orange trail offers stunning walking and hiking opportunities through the glorious countryside, all framed by the terracotta hue of the old ochre quarry.

        title: Dramatic Peaks
        description: Dramatic landscapes offer enthralling outdoor adventures and those in Provence are no different. Head for the white-tip peak of Mont Ventoux, which from a distance looks perpetually snow-capped. The stark white rock adds to the mystique of the mountain, known as one of the most treacherous climbs in the Tour de France. The summit views are excellent and if you can face the uphill cycle, incredibly rewarding. The Gorges du Verdon is another breathtaking spectacle; a sliver of turquoise cuts through vast cliffs, making the gorge the deepest and most beautiful in Europe. Take a canoe tour to fully appreciate the majestic scale of this natural wonder, spotting griffon vultures as you glide through the river valley…
