        description: Provence is guaranteed to give you lifestyle envy. Here, the living is good. From the bustling markets to the lively cafés and bars, Provençal life is laid-back, a fine balance of indulgence and activity. Sitting al fresco along charming boulevards, a refreshing rosé in hand and tapenade ready to be picked at, walking past softly-scented fields of lavender, and listening to the soft clicking sound of the pétanque game in the square. A pastis before dinner, a bottle from the cellar to accompany your evening as the sun slinks away… It’s a life worth living to its fullest, if even for a snapshot.

        title: Close to Sea
        description: Near the stunning Mediterranean coastline lie two outdoor scenes set to beguile any visitor. At the western point of the region, marked by the Rhône river delta, lies the Camargue. The wetlands host an array of bird life, along with iconic, wild white horses and flamingos basking in the sun. Bulls are herded by local cowboys setting the scene for a unique rural escape. East of the Camargue between Marseille and Cassis, you’ll find the white rocky outcrops of Les Calanques, that line the coastline here. Falling steeply into the sea, they offer up private coves and beaches, either accessible by a hike or by boat. For a serene spot on a quiet beach, discover the hidden shores of Les Calanques.

        title: Unforgettable Colours
        description: Provence is blessed with a sublime natural colour palette, a fact not lost on the artists who trailed the land in search of inspiration. The most iconic has to be the lavender fields, which grow across Luberon, Sault and Mont Ventoux. They bloom between June and August and once harvested, the villages and towns are filled with handcrafted lavender products that make perfect gifts. The Ochre Trail outside of Roussillon is of nice contrast to the deep purple of the fields. This burnt-orange trail offers stunning walking and hiking opportunities through the glorious countryside, all framed by the terracotta hue of the old ochre quarry.

        description: Dramatic landscapes offer enthralling outdoor adventures and those in Provence are no different. Head for the white-tip peak of Mont Ventoux, which from a distance looks perpetually snow-capped. The stark white rock adds to the mystique of the mountain, known as one of the most treacherous climbs in the Tour de France. The summit views are excellent and if you can face the uphill cycle, incredibly rewarding. The Gorges du Verdon is another breathtaking spectacle; a sliver of turquoise cuts through vast cliffs, making the gorge the deepest and most beautiful in Europe. Take a canoe tour to fully appreciate the majestic scale of this natural wonder, spotting griffon vultures as you glide through the river valley...
