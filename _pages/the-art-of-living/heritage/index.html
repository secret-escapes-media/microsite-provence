        title: Roman Gaul
        description: Provence boasts some of the most impressive Roman relics in the whole of France. Its important location on the road to Spain saw a flurry of Roman settlements spring up, leaving behind magnificent ruins of this fascinating empire. Discover the Roman town of Glanum with its impressive triumphal arch, the evocative hilltop Tropaeum Alpium, or the magnificent coliseum of Arles and the vast Pont du Gard. Original Roman bridges and roads are to be found across the region, making Provence a delight for history lovers.

        title: Medieval Towns
        description: Provence’s medieval towns and villages are a romantic vision of rural life in the south of France. Sat high on clifftops, often ringed-in by thick masonry and topped by a palatial keep, these towns and villages string together in a way that positively welcomes days of exploring each one-by-one. Discover the vast towers of Uzès, where the duke still lives in the grand castle, or the rustic streets of Lourmarin which won awards for their beauty, or the burnt-orange palette of Roussillon – the list is satisfyingly long.

      - id: avignon
        title: Avignon
        description: Avignon is so breathtaking in its medieval prowess it deserves its own entry. Packed with UNESCO Heritage sites, wandering the narrow medieval streets enchants any visitor. Discover the Palais des Papes, home of the Papacy during the middle ages and eventually leading to the Western Schism. Its grandeur and intricate interiors are a sight to behold, where outside the vast Gothic facade dominates the city. Find oddities like the Saint Bénézet Bridge, a quarter of which is missing, that gave rise to the famous French nursery rhyme. Avignon is a remarkable time capsule, with a significant story to tell those who listen…

        title: The Belle Epoque
        description: The coastline of Provence has been a celebrated summer destination for travellers over generations. Its glitz and glamour is no better represented by the Belle Epoque style found in its major coastal cities. Borrowing heavily from Art Nouveau, the times called for grandiose buildings and wide boulevards, from which the wealthy could strut their stuff in the elegance of the style. This opulent time is played out in the rich architecture of Nice’s Promenade des Anglais, the Croisette in Cannes and the Promenade du Soleil in Menton, along with plenty more fascinating examples hidden amongst the streets of the cities.

        title: Meet the Artists
        description: Provence has constantly drawn artists from far and wide. At a quick glance, it’s not hard to see why. The food, the weather, the lifestyle – it’s an incredibly tempting hideaway. From the coast to the mountains, Provence’s list of artists-in-residence reads like a who’s-who of the most celebrated and influential of their field – Van Gogh, Picasso, Monet, Matisse, Chagall, Renoir, Cézanne, Puget – many of whom settled here for some time. Whether it was the fair weather or the famous wine, Van Gogh in particular attributed it to the colour pallette and light of this beautiful region.

        title: Visit their Homes
        description: Visit the villages and towns that these illustrious artists were inspired by. Renoir was first to popularise the region, with Monet, Matisse and Cézanne quickly following. Aix-en-Provence was the hangout of Cézanne, now beset with an art trail dedicated to him. It was motivation enough for Picasso, who also moved to Provence and settled in the picturesque village of Mougin. Van Gogh found his home in Arles, painting some of his finest works in the region and, regrettably, hacking his ear off. Saint-Paul-de-vence found Chagall producing a large body of work, inspiring Miro and other celebrities to summer in the breathtakingly beautiful village.

        title: Discover their Works
        description: With such a fine artistic pedigree, Provence naturally offers a wealth of renowned art galleries. They scatter themselves throughout the region, offering art trails that extend from coast to mountain through the glorious Provence countryside. Nice hosts five major art institutions, with 24hr tickets allowing you to see them all cheaply. Marseille has the new MUCEM, with Aix-en-Provence home to the Musée Granet and Hôtel de Caumont. La Malmaison in Cannes and Le Musée de l’Annonciade in St Tropez offer a wide curation of 20th century works, completing any art lover’s adventure in this demonstrably creative region.

        title: Finish with a Book
        description: Provence also nurtures a fine literary heritage. Stretching far back to the 12th century, the Occitan literature that grew in the region lay the foundation for lyric and romantic verse for centuries to come. Its influence extended to Dante and Petrarch, the latter having lived in Fontaine de Vaucluse where a museum is dedicated to his work. A lasting legacy of this unique literature is the Félibrige, a collective of poets who set about a renaissance of Provençal life and language in the 19th century. Stark French absurdist Camus lived his final days here, now buried in Lourmarin, the hometown of British author Peter Mayle.
